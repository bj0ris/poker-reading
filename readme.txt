I want to make a game where the objective is to identify the winning (and perhaps all) hands in a game of texas hold-em poker.

Okay, I've decided to make a game where you are timed on identifying the winning hand out of five players after all five cards are showed.

1. Make visual representation of deal:
    a. Make a "bag" of all cards that are drawn randomly. X
    b. Keep track of the values and suits on the table and in the hands.  X
    c. Figure out the best hand for each "player". (Even the losing ones)
    d. Light up the winning hand(s) (and losing hand that was picked)
